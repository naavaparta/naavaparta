[[The Incels]] believe that men are oppressed within modern society. They discuss the barriers of dating double standards and male socialization. They see their exclusion from [[The Sexual Market]] as a consequence of socialized expectations of maleness from which they feel alienated.

Incels do not criticize toxic masculine socialization, but instead blame feminists and "social justice warriors" for invalidating male struggle and continuing to control access to the sex market. They both legitimize traditional ideas of masculinity *and* desire for more diversity of masculine expression.
