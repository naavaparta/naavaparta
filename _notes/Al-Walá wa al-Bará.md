Al-Walá wa al-Bará, literally loyalty and disavowal.

In [[Salafism]], the Salafis are encouraged to remain close to the community of true believers (or, the Salafis), but to distance themselves from non-believers, shun them, or even hate them.

The Salafis call [[Sufi]] *Quburiyyn*, grave worshippers, and the name for the [[Shia]] is *Rafida*, rejectionists. Shunning other groups is considered a part of the process of purifying Islam of heresy and innovation.
