The evolutionary view of religion was highly influenced by the work of Charles Darwin. Anthropologists such as James Frazer and Edward Tyler presented various theories about how religion had come to be and how it had evolved.

The basis for all evolutionary theories was that religion had evolved from simple ("primitive") religions towards more complex ones. At the apex of this evolution there was either Christianity or science/Atheism, depending on the worldview of the theorist.

Various "primitive" cultures were thought to be fossil-like remnants of the evolution of human culture. Their cultures were thought to represent the earliest, least developed levels of humanity. The "wild" were thought to be childlike and ignorant, and the duty of Europeans was to make them civilized.

In Tylor's view, there was a continuum of cultures: from "primitive" cultures to moden, "civilized", Western culture. 

Better keep in mind that [[Christianity Not Like Other Religions]].
