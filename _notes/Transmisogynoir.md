A *portmanteau* of words trans + miso + gyny + noir. The end result, *transmisogynoir*, is a neologism that means the prejudice against Black trans women.

The building blocks of the word are:
- **trans**: transgender (from Latin)
- **miso**: hatred, contempt, or prejudice (from Ancient Greek)
- **gyny**: woman (from Ancient Greek)
- **noir**: black (from French)

It is a necessary term to draw attention how Black trans women are at the crossroads of multiple axis prejudice: anti-Blackness, transphobia, and misogyny.
