Salafism is a branch of Sunni [[Islam]].

### Al-Salaf al-Salih

The Salafis seek to return to the ways of *al-Salaf al-Salih*, the Pious Predecessors (the first three generations of Muslims). Most Muslims see the *al-Salaf al-Salih* as an inspiration, as that era is believed to exemplify the pure form of Islam.

### Wahhabism

*Wahhabism* is a subset of Salafism. Wahhabism is the state religion of Saudi Arabia—but a Wahhabi would not use the word Wahhabi to describe themselves. It is a word used by outsiders, and sometimes considered offensive.

Modern Salafism (the word has been used to describe other movements before) emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a pietistic movement based on theological principles, and its goal is to purify Islam to its authentic beliefs.

### The Salafi Way

The Salafi approach is heavily textual.

The three approved sources are the Qur'an, the Sunnah (Hadiths), and the Consensus of the Salaf. The way the sources are read is very strict and direct.

Many Salafis hold that the sources provide answers to all possible questions: simply read the text and get an answer!

The Salafis criticize the visiting of graves of saints or prophets. They also criticize celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, and any form of intercession between Allah and the believer.

### Al-Walá wa al-Bará

*Al-Walá wa al-Bará*, loyalty and disavowal. The Salafis are encouraged to remain close to the community of true believers, but to distance themselves from non-believers, shun them, or even hate them. It is an example of [[Us vs Them Mentality]].

The Salafis call Sufis *Quburiyyn*, grave worshippers, and they call Shiites *Rafida*, rejectionists. Shunning other groups is a part of the process of purifying Islam of heresy and innovation, and it is characteristic of Salafi absolutism.

### Salafi Views

The Salafi movement in general is influenced by the *Hanbali* law school. It is often considered the most strict.

The Salafi movement is heterogenous. A majority of Salafis are uninterested in politics (quietists). They think of a pious life and the purification of Islam from the inside more important than political action.

However, there are also more politically active groups. Some consider political action a tool to fight against innovation and polytheism. Some groups have taken this so far that their actions include violence. These violent groups grew from Salafism and belong to the broad Salafi category, but they do not make up the majority of Salafis. Their ideology is based on the basic Salafi doctrines and ideas.

### Salafism Spread

Even non-Salafis have adopted ideas and terminology that is common in the Salafi movement.

The Salafis have produced a lot of accessible information. In the 20th century, this was journals. Today, it is internet presence. Salafism nearly dominates the Islamic online space today. Many sites where legal opinions are given on Islamic topics are usually Salafi or Salafi-influenced, however, labeled as "Islamic". Social media is dominated by Salafi personalities, which means that the Salafis are a major authority as representing Islam to a wider audience.

But why has Salafism spread so efficiently?

They claim that they have absolute or exclusive access to the truth and the pure version of Islam, and the only correct way to reach paradise. This makes Salafism attractive to many.

The purity of the doctrine transcends national and cultural borders, and speaks directly to the individual, inviting them to a community beyond all of these aspects.  This sense of universalism appeals to young Muslims and migrants who might feel discriminated against.
