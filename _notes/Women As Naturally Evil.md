Incels see female evilness as a combination of evolution, biology, and culture. They view women as evolutionarily compelled to manipulate men.

The normative order of women as naturally evil is consistent with the findings that [[Sexism]] is a key component in the ideology of [[The Incels]]. They view feminists (and others who advocate for gender equality) as an enemy.
