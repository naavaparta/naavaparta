In [[Salafism]], the sources are read strictly and directly, and only three sources are approved: [[The Qur'an]], the Sunnah (Hadiths), and the Consensus of the Salaf.

Many Salafis hold that the sources provide an answer to all possible questions.

In the Salafi view,  the visiting of graves of saints or prophets should be criticized, as should celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad, and any form of intercession between Allah and the believer.
