Comparisons between [[AvPD]] and [[Social Anxiety Disorder]].

Generally speaking, an AvPD patient's symptoms are more severe than those of a patient with SAD.

Restraint in intimate relationships seems to be AvPD-specific.

Differential diagnosis between AvPD and SAD can be difficult. However, a key difference seems to be that with people with AvPD, the fear of social situations seems to be a more integral part of the sense of self.
