Many scholars have discovered that income inequality is linked to many social problems, including crime rates and homicide rates.

In communities where there is great income inequality, there is also more anger, frustration, resentment, and hostility. Inequality may lead to status insecurity, which may turn into stress, anxiety, and aggression.

Does it matter if the situation is truly inequal or if it is a matter of perception? *When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression*? Consider [[The Incels]].

Also, is there a link between being an incel and income inequality? I would hypothesize that yes, there is.
