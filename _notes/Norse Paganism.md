Norse Paganism is the modernization of the religious beliefs of ancient Germanic peoples. It is also called Heathenry, but personally I cannot pronounce that in a way that anyone would understand, so I prefer to call it Norse Paganism. Also, my native language (Finnish) does not differentiate between Paganism and Heathenry, so neither do I intuitively.

Norse Paganism is sometimes associated with racism, transphobia, and similar discriminatory beliefs. I do not hold these views, but I definitely understand why some associate my religion with discrimination. This is why I am always wary of which pagans I associate myself with.
