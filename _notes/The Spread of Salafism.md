Even non-Salafis have adopted ideas and terminology that is common in the Salafi movement, and [[Salafism]] has spread quickly.

Why?

The Salafis have produced a lot of accessible information. In the 20th century, this was journals. Today, it is internet content. Salafism nearly dominates the Islamic online space today. Many sites where legal opinions are given on Islamic topics are usually Salafi or Salafi-influenced, however, labeled as "Islamic". Social media is dominated by Salafi personalities, which means that the Salafis are a major authority as representing [[Islam]] to a wider audience.

The Salafi claims to have absolute or exclusive access to the truth and the pure version of Islam, and the only correct way to reach paradise, make Salafism attractive to many.

The purity of the doctrine transcends national and cultural borders, and speaks directly to the invididual, inviting them to a community beyond all those aspects. This universalism appeals especially to young Muslims and migrants who might feel discriminated against.
