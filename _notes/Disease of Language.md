F. Max Müller's ([[Study of Religion]]) theory of "a disease of language" is used to describe the process that mythology transforms names of abstract concepts into beings and stories.

In Müller's view, gods began as words that expressed abstract ideas. However, myths transformed them into imagined personalities. Abstract concepts, in Latin *nomina*, eventually turned into deities, *numina*, singular *numen*.
