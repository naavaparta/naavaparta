The incels (*involuntary celibates*) operate mainly in online communities. The focus of their discussions is their difficulty in attaining sexual relationships. The incels believe that they themselves cannot affect their sexual inactivity.

Five interrelated norms of the incel community:
- [[The Sexual Market]]
- [[Women As Naturally Evil]]
- [[Legitimizing Masculinity]]
- [[Male Oppression]]
- [[Incel Violence]]
