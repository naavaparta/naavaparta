Agender is a gender identity that literally means *without gender*. An agender person does not have a gender, or they feel that their gender is neutral. This can be grouped under nonbinary, but it is not an universal experience.

For me, being agender is distinct from being nonbinary. Nonbinary people seem to have a gender, it's just *nonbinary*, whileas I, an agender person, do not have a gender at all. A meaningful difference, at least for me.
