When it comes to politics, the adherents of [[Salafism]] are a heterogenous group.

A majority of Salafis are uninterested in politics (quietists). They think a pious life and the purification of Islam from the inside is more important than political action.

It would be dishonest to say all Salafis are quietists: there are also more politically active groups. Some consider political action a tool to fight against innovation and polytheism. Some groups have taken this so far that their "toolkit" includes violence.

The violent groups (such as al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and Islamic State) grew from Salafism and belong to the broad Salafi category. They do not represent a majority of Salafis. Their ideology is based on the basic Salafi doctrines and ideas.
