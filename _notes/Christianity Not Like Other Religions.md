In the [[Study of Religion]], Müller's comparative linguistic research and Tylor's anthropological and evolutionistic research paved the way for attempts at tracing down the birth of religions; [[Cultural Evolutionism]].

This approach was *not* approved for Christianity or other monotheistic religions with holy books. It was thought that their dogma and praxis weren't comparable to other religions.
