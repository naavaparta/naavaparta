Incel discussions are focused on making sense of dating. Most incels seem to believe that the most important goal of a human being is to find a mate and reproduce. In an incel point of view, their physical appearance is to blame for their inability to have sex.

**Fakecel**: someone who could get mates if they tried.
**Truecel**: someone who cannot get mates even if they try.

Incels see themselves as a marginalized and oppressed group in a society in which they have little to no value.
