[[The Incels]] normalize male aggression and male sexualization of females: "women desire to be sexualized, and males are programmed to sexualize".

Many incels have a strong sense of having missed out on teenage love. They glorify "young love" and describe minor girls ("jail baits") as most attractive. They claim that the attraction to minor girls is "biologically normal" and "appropriate". In the view of the incels, the age of consent is an unreasonable social construct, another way in which they are oppressed by women.

In the incel view, women are inferior. This rationalization legitimizes the rights of men to oppress women. Women and men are not and should not be equals, according to this view.
