## Obsidian

I take notes in Obsidian. I take notes of almost every piece of media I consume. Everything can give rise to thoughts and ideas, so I'm almost always taking notes. If not factual notes (like from informational things), then inspirational notes (for writing). The latter notes don't live in my Obsidian, nor do they live on this website. They live in my notebook and in my Scrivener.

## Atom

I edit non-note files in Atom. I'm always searching for the perfect application to do development in. Atom isn't perfect, but so far I like it quite a bit. I seldom get attached to apps (unless it's Scrivener or Obsidian).

## Github

I commit whenever I feel like it. I don't understand Github fully, but I quite like it still. I should really search YouTube for a video regarding Github. I mean, at the moment I use it without understanding all the terminology, which is kind of embarrassing. Is there a "Github for n00bs" kind of video...? Should be!

## Netlify

I use Netlify (which I cannot type without typo'ing a hundred times every time!) to deploy. I'm sticking with Netlify mainly because I'm not a wizard when it comes to this stuff, and Netlify is quite straightforward. Netlify has a limit on build minutes and I'm not looking to spend any money on this stuff as of right now.
