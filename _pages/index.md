I'm a passionate learner who cannot get enough knowledge in their brain.

However, this site is <b>not</b> a cornucopia of timeless wisdom, nor is this filled with fully thought-out things and beautifully crafted essays. Rather, it is me, learning to learn in public, trying to connect bits and pieces of knowledge.

I write about gender and sexuality, psychology, social justice, society and social problems, religions, and a myriad of other things. Looking forward to finding even more topics to write about.

I'm using Megumi Tanaka's <a href="https://garden.megu.space/">Green Web Template</a> which I have edited a bit, to better suit my needs, my personality, and my aesthetic.
