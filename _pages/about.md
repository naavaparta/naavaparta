I'm Naava. Finnish. 31 years old. [[Agender]]. Using they/them pronouns.

## Learning to Learn in Public

I have [[Avoidant Personality Disorder]], and my fear of rejection is terrible. My fear of being ridiculed and laughed at is terrible. Most of the time, I go out of my way to avoid any and all human interaction. Posting my learning online is a way to learn to deal with being a work-in-progress, as that is what being a human is all about. Posting my English texts online is a way to learn to cope with not having a perfect grasp of the English language. How could I? It's not my native language!

Why not write in Finnish, then? Because my goal is to gain a better understanding of the English grammar, to expand my vocabulary, and to be able to fully communicate even the most abstract ideas. At the moment, I'm somewhat confident when it comes to colloquial English, but if I ever plan on studying Environmental Engineering or Social Sciences (in English but in Finland), I need to "step up my English game". Sounds logical, right?

I dream about eventually going to school (the aforementioned Environmental Engineering or Social Sciences) and getting a job (instead of being on disability for Bipolar Disorder and AvPD), but it cannot happen until I learn to live with my own imperfections. It cannot happen until I fully realize that not everyone is out to deliberately hurt me.

## Other Hobbies

I'm an avid writer, I've been a NaNoWriMo participant since 2007, and I've won several times. My favorite genre to write has been fantasy (both high and low) for as long as I can remember. I occasionally sprinkle in horror elements. I would like to broaden my horizons by writing literary fiction eventually.

I also love to knit. I like to defy superstitions, which is why I've knit my partner two sweaters. No marital problems in sight! I also knit my mother, my siblings, their partners, and their offspring socks for every Christmas, although as a follower of [[Norse Paganism]] I don't celebrate Christmas. They, however, do, and I'm glad to have something to knit.

I also photograph quite a bit, although I'm currently "between cameras" so to speak.

I occasionally play video games, but only casually. The Sims 4, TES V: Skyrim, and NieR: Automata are my favorites, although I've yet to finish NieR: Automata. Skyrim's main story I know by heart (and despise the Diplomatic Immunity quest!), and The Sims 4 is... well, it's a Sims game.
